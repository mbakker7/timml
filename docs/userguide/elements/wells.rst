Wells
=====

There are two types of wells: wells for which the total discharge is specified and
wells for which the head inside the well is specified. Both types of wells may have an
entry resistance (skin effect) defined by the resistance :math:`c` (dimension: time).
The discharge :math:`Q_i` in layer :math:`i` is a function of the head :math:`h_i` in
layer :math:`i` just outside the well and the head :math:`h_w` inside the well:

    .. math::
        Q_i = 2\pi r_w H_i(h_i - h_w)/c

1. :class:`~timml.well.Well` is a well for which the total discharge is specified. The
   total discharge is distributed across the layers in which the well is screened such
   that the head inside the well is the same in each screened layer.

2. :class:`~timml.well.HeadWell` is a well for which the head inside the well is
   specified. The discharge in each layer is computed such that the head in all screened
   layers is equal to the specified head.
