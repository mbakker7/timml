The transmissivity of the aquifer is approximated as constant. The porosity of the aquifer is 0.3. Far away from the pumping well, flow is uniform from East to West with a gradient of 0.001. The head at $(x, y)=(-1000, 0)$ m is fixed at 41 m. The extraction well is located at $(x,y)=(-400,0)$ m, the discharge of the well is $Q=50$ m$^3$/d and the radius of the well is $r_w=0.2$ m.
